## Usage

These `*.cape` cursors are to be used in the [Mousecape](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape) app on macOS, but I think they can be adapted to other systems as well.


## Note

The Mousecape app doesn't work properly on macOS Sonoma+.


## Any suggestions?

I recommend using the KDE Breeze cursor! It looks modern, stylish, and minimalistic.
